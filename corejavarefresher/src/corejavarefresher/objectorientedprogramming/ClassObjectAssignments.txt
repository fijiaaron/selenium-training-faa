Assignment - Create a Circle Class

having 
radius as double 
color as String

It should have two constructors
- one accepts radius, color as parameter and 
- one is blank(no parameter)

Provide the following methods:
- getter and setter for radius
- getter and setter for color
- calculate the area (radius*radius*Math.PI)

Create another class having main method. This is to
create objects of Circle class.
Create four objects of Circle and provide different radius 
and color.
Print radius, color and area of all the four circles on console.




Create a cylinder class inherit from circle
having height as additional instance variable
It should have two constructors, one with three parameters, radius,color and height and 
other without any parameter
the following methods:
- setter and getter for height
- Override the getArea() method in Circle to implement area of the Cylinder
- get volume which internally calls getArea() method of circle (height * area)
- create another class having main method. 
- Create 3 objects of Cylinder having different values of color, radius and height
